    <p><span>Michael Ryan Flatley (born July 16, 1958) is an American dancer, choreographer, and musician. He became internationally known for Irish dance shows Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, and Celtic Tiger.</span>
    </p>
        <p>
In 2003, an allegation was made by real estate agent Tyna Marie Robertson that Flatley had raped her in 2002 at a Las Vegas hotel. 
In the subsequent court case she was ordered to pay $11 million compensation to Flatley for defamation and extortion.
In April 2006, Flatley spoke about his discovery of a facial skin cancer.
At the 10th Anniversary of <span>Lord of the Dance</span> in June 2006, Flatley was accompanied by dancer Niamh O'Brien, who dances with him in Celtic Tiger.
 O'Brien had danced with Flatley in <span>Riverdance</span>, Lord of the Dance, and <span>Feet of Flames</span> before they shared the stage in <span>Celtic Tiger</span>. 
 The two shortly thereafter announced that they were dating, and were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Fermoy, County Cork, 
 on October 14, 2006.
On November 15, 2006 Flatley was admitted to a private London hospital with a viral infection. All the fall and winter tours of 
his latest production, Celtic Tiger, were cancelled. He was discharged two weeks later.
He and his wife, Niamh Flatley have a son, Michael St. James, born in 2007.
On May 23, 2015 Flatley was interviewed by Graham Norton for his BBC Radio 2 show and revealed that he had problems with various bones, 
including the T1 and T5, the C3, the L5 vertebrae and the Sacroiliac joint in his spine, a damaged left knee, a torn right calf muscle, 
two ruptured Achilles tendons, a fractured rib and a broken bone in his foot. He confirmed that he planned to retire at the end of 2015, 
with his last scheduled appearance in Austria on December 5.
